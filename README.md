# HamiltonianNerualNetworksProject
This is a repo containing my master thesis work. Here, I recreate and do further reaserach on the topic of Hamiltonian neural networks for physics simulations i.e. dynamic system prediction. THe repo contains models used for a spring system, ideal pendulum and a real world pendulum dataset.
